# Simple Line Graph
Created purely as a "Hmm, I've never made that before because I've always used a thirdparty." during Isolation. Based on the Dribbble design linked above. Simple install, easy usage. 

## Installation
To install, just move the SimpleChart.swift and CurvedAlgorithm.swift files into your project, alongside adding the bg-selected image into your asset catalogue. 

## Usage
Either create a UIView programatically or in storyboard, and assign the SimpleChart class to it. 

```swift
let simpleChart:SimpleChart = SimpleChart(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 0, height: 0))
```
